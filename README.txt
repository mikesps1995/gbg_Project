This is experimental code and we are trying out github as a means of
backup and distribution.

It will eventually be released to GPL but it is not yet ready for that.

Did a bunch of changes while re-working the interface board.  Moved a couple

cleaner.  Did a push to a branch so as to not mess Kat up.
